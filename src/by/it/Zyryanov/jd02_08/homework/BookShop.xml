            <Description>Sherlock Holmes is the world's only consulting detective. Money and prestige don't interest
                him, simply the chance to flex his intellectual muscles and practise his unique method of deduction are
                enough. Following him through a series of problems, you are able to watch a great mind at work and delve
                into the criminal world of London.

            <Description>With H.G. Wellsâ€™ other novels, The War of the Worlds was one of the first and greatest works of
                science fiction ever to be written. Even long before man had learned to fly, H.G. Wells wrote this story
                of the Martian attack on England. These unearthly creatures arrive in huge cylinders, from which they
                escape as soon as the metal is cool.
