<br>With H.G. Wells&rsquo; other novels, The War of the Worlds was one of the first and greatest works of
                science fiction ever to be written. Even long before man had learned to fly, H.G. Wells wrote this story
                of the Martian attack on England. These unearthly creatures arrive in huge cylinders, from which they
                escape as soon as the metal is cool.
