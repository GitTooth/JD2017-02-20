            "These so-called microelectrical mechanical sensors or MEMS could be implanted under the skin, for example, to monitor the blood-sugar level of a diabetic and automatically deliver the correct dose of insulin. " +
            "Most existing MEMS are made from silicon, glass and plastic. " +
            "However, drug-delivery chips made from these materials would have to be removed when the drug runs out.\n" +
            "Now Deniz Armani and Chang Liu of the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in the US have developed a technique that will allow MEMS to be built from biodegradable polymers. " +
            "The microstructure of these chips is moulded from polycaprolactone, a cheap plastic developed over a decade ago for use in contraceptive implants.\n" +
            "Armani and Liu created the microstructures by pouring the molten polymer into a 3-D mould etched from silicon. " +
            "However, the metal tracks could not be deposited using standard techniques because the polymer has a low melting point. " +
            "Instead the Illinois team developed a new technique to transfer a patterned metal film onto the surface of the plastic.\n" +
            "The pattern was etched into a 400 mm thick gold film that had been evaporated onto a silicon substrate. " +
            "Next the substrate was heated and the polymer was allowed to melt on its surface. " +
            "The gold film adhered more strongly to the polymer than the silicon, so the gold tracks were left on the plastic microstructure after it had been cooled and removed from the substrate.\n" +
            "The moulding and patterning steps were combined to produce structures that contain microcavities filled with liquid and sealed with a thin gold film. " +
            "Armani and Liu plan to investigate other biodegradable plastics and develop an active drug-releasing chip that could be inserted into the body.\n";
