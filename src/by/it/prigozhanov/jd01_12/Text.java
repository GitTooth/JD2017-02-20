            " To accomplish this, IGA tools aggregate and correlate disparate identity and access rights " +
            "data that is distributed throughout the IT landscape to enhance control over user access. This " +
            "aggregated data serves as the basis for core IGA functions including identity life cycle and entitlements" +
            " management, access requests, workflow orchestration, access certification, fulfilment via automated connectors" +
            " and service tickets, reporting, and analytics. IGA also provides a number of ancillary functions, including role " +
            "and policy management and auditing. Vendors in this Magic Quadrant have solutions delivered as software or as a service " +

            "the needs of most common use cases — this is certainly true for all vendors covered in this Magic Quadrant. The basic functionality" +
            " associated with core capabilities is delivered in a relatively consistent manner by products in the market. Most differentiation among" +
            " products is found in ancillary capabilities.\n" +

            "Every vendor covered in this Magic Quadrant delivers IGA capabilities as on-premises software, some vendors also have other" +
            " IGA options delivered as a service. When evaluating the Ability to Execute — specifically the product/service evaluation" +
            " criterion, the focus was on the most capable IGA offering from the vendor, which in every case except for Saviynt was the" +
            " on-premises version. Generally, when vendors offer a cloud version, they offer a subset of the capabilities seen in their on-premises version";
